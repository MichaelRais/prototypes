<ul>
<li>A simple RESTful prototype of a microservice built in Spark framework, using J-Unit in Maven via Surefire plug-in.
<li>Still filling in documentation, and sanding rough edges in this <i>functioning</i> prototype.   
<li>I'm now a fan of the Spark framework for Java microservices:  http://sparkjava.com
