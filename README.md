# Java microservice prototype in Spark framework with JUnit via Maven
<ul>
<li>A simple RESTful prototype of a microservice built in Spark framework, using JUnit in Maven via the Surefire plug-in.
<li>The prototype itself loads and serves country code lookups.  If you have Maven installed and download the source, you can run the prototype.
<li>I'm still sanding rough edges in this <i>functioning</i> prototype.   Documentation just got started.
<li>I'm now a fan of the Spark framework for Java microservices:  http://sparkjava.com
</ul>
